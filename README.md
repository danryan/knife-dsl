# Knife-DSL

A small library that lets you drive Chef's `knife` programmatically

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'knife-dsl'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install knife-dsl

## Usage

The main feature of this library is the ability to drive knife as a method call
as opposed to an individual program. This has a number of benefits:

* It's a lot faster
* You can capture output
* You're relying on code that has a contract to maintain compatible with Chef
* Use knife plugins all you want without breaking your workflow
* Optionally, Chef becomes constrained by a gemfile (as do the plugins you use)
  and that constraint remains consistent.

It provides two calls, `knife` and `knife_capture` that are injected into the
top-level namespace automatically. Additionally, if you are using `rake`, it
will detect this and make it available to rake's DSL as well.

If you wish to use this code elsewhere, just `include Chef::Knife::DSL` into
your classes/modules.

Both commands take two argument-passing styles. Both use an array of strings to
represent the ARGV passed to knife, but there is additionally a shorthand to
make the actual subcommand stand out: if you supply a symbol or string with
underscore-delimited subcommand names, it will automatically convert this for
you. This allows you to visually distinguish a command from its arguments.

knife-dsl allows the use of alternative Chef Configs via the `CHEF_CONFIG`
environment variable.

## Example

Here's a `Rakefile` which lists nodes in one task, and in another, converts the
node metadata supplied by `knife node show $x` to something suitable to display
with `pp`. The practical applications of both tasks are pretty specious, but
they're small and display the functionality.

```ruby
require 'knife/dsl'
require 'pp'
require 'json'

task :list_nodes do
  knife :node_list
end

task :show_node, :node_name do |task_name, args|
  stdout, stderr = knife_capture :node_show, [args[:node_name], '-F', 'j']
  pp JSON.load(stdout)
end
```
